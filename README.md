        - Create vehicle in database
        - Generate **QR code** for the vehicle using vehicle_id
            - Package Used: `qrcode`
        - Store QR code in **static** folder
        - In real-world, print the QR code and paste it on Vehicles
- **Booking**
    - User will visit the store for booking
    - In real-world will scan the QR code of vehicle and enter booking details
    - Here I have used the following steps for booking
        - On frontend, a QR code scanner will be implemented using OpenCV library.
        - It will send the scanned QR code path or url to server
        - Server will decode the Vehicle_id from QR code
        - And then that vehicle will be booked till mentioned date
        - mark the vehicle as `in_use`
    - POST: /api/booking/book_vehicle/
        - Send qr_code_path and end_date to server
        - booking will be confirmed by server with booking id
    - GET: /api/booking/return_vehicle?booking_id=<booking_id>
        - send booking_id to server
        - server will accept the vehicle and mark the vehicle `available`
